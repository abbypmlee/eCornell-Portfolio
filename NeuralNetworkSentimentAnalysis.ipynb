    "### Improve Model's Performance and Prevent Overfitting \n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks can be prone to overfitting. Notice that the training accuracy is 100% but the validation accuracy is around 80%. This indicates that our model is overfitting; it will not perform as well on new, previously unseen data as it did during training. We want to have an accurate idea of how well our model will generalize to new data. Our goal is to have our training and validation accuracy scores be as close as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are different techniques that can be used to prevent overfitting, for the purpose of this exercise we will focus on two methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Changing the number of epochs. Too many epochs can lead to overfitting of the training dataset, whereas too few epochs may result in underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Adding dropout regularization. During training, the nodes of a particular layer may always become influenced only by the output of a particular node in the previous layer, causing overfitting. Dropout regularization is a technique that randomly drops a number of nodes in a neural network during training as a way of adding randomization and preventing nodes from becoming dependent on one another. Adding dropout regularization can reduce overfitting and also improve the performance of the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Task:</b> \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tweak the variable `num_epochs` above and restart and rerun all of the cells above. Evaluate the performance of the model on the training data and the validation data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add Keras `Dropout` layers after one or all hidden layers. Add the following line of code after you add a hidden layer to your model object:  `nn_model.add(keras.layers.Dropout(.25))`. The parameter `.25` is the fraction of the nodes to drop. You can experiment with this value as well. Restart and rerun all of the cells above. Evaluate the performance of the model on the training data and the validation data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Analysis:</b> \n",
    "In the cell below, specify the different approaches you used to reduce overfitting and summarize which configuration led to the best generalization performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Did changing the number of epochs prevent overfitting? Which value of `num_epochs` yielded the closest training and validation accuracy score? \n",
    "\n",
    "Did adding dropout layers prevent overfitting? How so? Did it also improve the accuracy score when evaluating the validation data? How many dropout layers did you add and which fraction of nodes did you drop? \n",

    "I started by experimenting with different numbers of epochs by dropping the number from 55 to 40. With only 40 epochs, I only saw a decrease of  in the difference between training accuracy and validation accuracy of 0.0169 (from 0.1824 to 0.1655). I continued lowering the number of epochs until I hovered around 15, at which point the difference between training and validation accuracy was only 0.124 (training accuracy of 0.776 and validation accuracy of 0.652). I went back and forth between 15 and 10 but noticed that I seemed to get the best results at 15. I then began adding dropout layers, starting with one and progressing to three. I'm not sure if this was a fluke, but I reran the network multiple time and found that a higher proportion of dropout nodes (0.25) resulted in a validation accuracy that was actually higher than the training accuracy. I ended with three layers, all dropping 25% of their nodes, achieving a final training accuracy of 0.6467 and a validation accuracy of 0.7297."

To state that I was disappointed is a severe understatement.  After reading this book I now have little to no desire to visit the \"land down under;\" my only hope is that I will completely forget what I read in Bryson\\'s book so that I may one day look forward to and enjoy visiting Australia.  (Senility be merciful and consume me hastily!)\\n\\nMy best estimate is that Bryson was commissioned to write a ~350 page book about Australia.  During and / or after his trip, his creative sense must have taken a vacation of its own.  I have rarely struggled so much to get through a book as I did with this one.  Bryson even stooped so low as to use an urban legend as a \"story\" relayed second-hand from one of the Australians he \"met.\"  Such a stunt makes me question if any of his accounts are real in any of his books.\\n\\nThe only saving grace to this book was the educational tangents.  These, at least, provided for some interesting reading.\\n\\nAfter comparing notes with another person who ventured to read another of Bryson\\'s books (\"I\\'m A Stranger Here Myself\") after she read \"A Walk in the Woods,\" it would appear that \"In a Sunburned Country\" is not the only snore-fest that Bryson has churned out.  Perhaps he isn\\'t a \"one hit wonder,\" but I for one am not going to waste my time or money finding out.\\n\\nSo, if you are looking for the same caliber of writing that Bryson provided in \"A Walk in the Woods,\" look to another author or prepare to be greatly disappointed. \\n']\n",

The loss decreased from 0.667 to 0.637 and the accuracy increased from 0.724 to 0.773 when I changed the learning rate to 0.01. The network still finished training in only 6.4 seconds. I then added two more hidden layers and the training time was still low at 5.14 seconds, but the loss increased to 0.693 and the accuracy decreased to 0.475. I then removed those layers but made every layer have 64 nodes, which interestingly yielded loss and accuracy values that were very close to the previous model. I similarly played around with different values for min_df but the loss and accuracy was relatively similar despite me re-running the cells from the very beginning. Unfortunately, I couldn't experiment with different values for ngram_range because my kernel kept dying."
