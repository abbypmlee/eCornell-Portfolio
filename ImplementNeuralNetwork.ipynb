    "When I changed the learning rate from 0.1 to 0.01, the model still appeared to perform much better on the training data versus the test data, suggesting that it was still overfitting. However, the accuracy and loss for both training and validation data were overall smoother with a smaller step size, which makes sense as the model is learning more gradually. It also was trained slightly quicker, taking only 85.64 seconds compared to 91.44 at a learning rate of 0.1. When I decreased num_epochs to 50 compared to 100, it obviously took much less time to train (only 53.39 seconds). Interestingly, this was still overe half of the total time it took to train 100 epochs. However, the model's performance on the training data still far surpassed its performance on the test data. When I changed the unit parameter of each hidden layer to be 128, it unsurprisingly took even longer to complete all 100 epochs (105.68 seconds). Also, it appeared to be overfitting even more severely due the the increased complexity of the model."
